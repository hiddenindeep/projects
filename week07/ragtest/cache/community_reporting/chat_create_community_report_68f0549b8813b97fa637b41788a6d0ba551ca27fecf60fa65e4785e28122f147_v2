As a villager and aunt of Li Daguo, she holds a respected position in the social hierarchy and plays a crucial role in facilitating connections between key individuals, most notably linking Li Daguo to Wang Xiaomeng. Her influence extends beyond familial ties, as she actively participates in mediating relationships and orchestrating strategic alliances. One of her notable actions includes helping Xie Xiaomei by fabricating a fake illness to navigate personal and social pressures, showcasing her resourcefulness and deep involvement in the lives of others.\n\nXie Dajiao’s character is further defined by her complex romantic entanglements. She is initially married to Li Fu, and although their relationship is marked by conflict, they ultimately reconcile, demonstrating her capacity for emotional resilience and commitment. Simultaneously, she becomes romantically involved with Wang Mosheng, revealing a dynamic and evolving personal life. Her unexpected courtship by Wang Dali during a failed marriage arrangement adds another layer of intrigue to her character, underscoring her desirability and influence in village affairs.\n\nDespite her active role in political maneuvering and secret information exchange, Xie Dajiao remains protected from surveillance due to intelligence leaks orchestrated by Liu Neng, indicating her strategic importance and the high stakes involved in her actions. This protection highlights her significance within the broader network of power and influence in the village.\n\nOverall, Xie Dajiao is portrayed as a shrewd, compassionate, and resilient woman who navigates personal, familial, and political challenges with intelligence and grace. Her actions—whether mediating disputes, aiding allies, or pursuing romance—contribute significantly to the narrative’s momentum and depth. Through her connections and decisions, she emerges as a key architect of relationships and a central force in shaping the village’s social and emotional landscape.

He does not succeed in the arranged marriage and later becomes involved in a romantic development with Xie Dajiao.\",2\n8,LIU YISHUI,\"Liu Yishui is a multifaceted character portrayed by actor Cai Weili in the narrative, depicted as a thoughtful and emotionally sensitive villager with a deep sense of integrity and romantic longing. Initially introduced as the manager of a livestock farm, Liu Yishui is characterized by his quiet strength, moral clarity, and a quiet admiration for Wang Xiaomeng. He plays a pivotal role in exposing Zhao Yutian’s deception, orchestrating a scheme that reveals the fraudster’s true intentions and restores trust within the community. This act underscores his sense of justice and leadership, establishing him as a respected figure among his peers.\n\nHis emotional journey becomes more complex through his interactions with Wang Xiaomeng, whom he assists in modifying a tofu grinder. Though her request is purely practical, Liu Yishui misinterprets her gesture as a sign of romantic interest, sparking a deep emotional attachment. This misinterpretation creates personal tension, particularly in relation to Xie Xiaomei, with whom he previously shared a meaningful relationship. Liu Yishui’s feelings for Wang Xiaomeng grow stronger over time, creating a delicate emotional triangle. However, he remains supportive and wise, advising Wang Xiaomeng to remain calm during moments of emotional turmoil, demonstrating his maturity and emotional depth.\n\nDespite the emotional complications, Liu Yishui’s path ultimately leads to reconciliation and personal growth. He is deeply affected by Xie Xiaomei’s departure, missing her profoundly. Their emotional bond is rekindled through a heartfelt reunion facilitated by a flower car, symbolizing renewal and the enduring power of love. This moment marks a significant transformation in Liu Yishui’s character—a shift from confusion and internal conflict to emotional clarity and fulfillment. His journey reflects themes of longing, miscommunication, moral courage, and the redemptive power of genuine connection.\n\nIn summary, Liu Yishui is a complex villager and livestock farm manager whose life is defined by quiet heroism, emotional introspection, and evolving romantic experiences. His relationship with both Xie Xiaomei and Wang Xiaomeng reveals layers of personal growth, moral integrity, and the transformative nature of love and reconciliation. Portrayed by Cai Weili with nuanced depth, Liu Yishui emerges as a compelling figure whose journey embodies resilience, empathy, and the enduring pursuit of meaningful human connection.\",3\n54,XIE XIAOMEI,\"Xie Xiaomei is a complex character portrayed by Du Xiaoxiong in the drama, known for her deep emotional ties to Liu Yishui and her central role in the farm’s transformation. Originally Liu Yishui’s former partner, Xie Xiaomei returns to the farm after a period of absence, driven by a desire to restore harmony and stability to the community. Her return marks a pivotal moment in the narrative, as she takes an active role in revitalizing the farm. She proposes a large-scale development plan aimed at modernizing and expanding the agricultural operations, demonstrating her vision and leadership.\n\nHowever, Xie Xiaomei’s emotional journey is marked by vulnerability and insecurity, particularly in her relationship with Liu Yishui. She exhibits strong emotional dependence on him, and when she suspects he is romantically involved with Wang Xiaomeng, she becomes deeply upset and confrontational. In a pivotal act of manipulation, she pretends to be ill in an attempt to test Liu Yishui’s loyalty and commitment. This strategy is supported by Xie Dajiao, who aligns with her emotionally and further isolates her from Liu Yishui. When Liu Yishui fails to visit her during her supposed illness, Xie Xiaomei grows increasingly distant and resentful, reinforcing her sense of betrayal and abandonment.\n\nDespite these emotional struggles, Xie Xiaomei remains a key figure in the farm’s revitalization. Her actions—both personal and strategic—reflect a woman torn between her desire for connection and her need for validation, yet ultimately driven to rebuild not just her own life but the community around her. Her development plan symbolizes a broader ambition to reclaim agency and purpose. While her emotional instability and deceitful tactics create tension, they also underscore her depth and the complexity of her character.\n\nIn summary, Xie Xiaomei is a multifaceted woman portrayed by Du Xiaoxiong, whose return to the farm serves both personal and communal aims. She is a former partner of Liu Yishui, emotionally dependent on him, and prone to testing his loyalty through deception. Her actions, though sometimes controversial, are rooted in a desire for emotional security and a vision for the farm’s future.

Their alliance is initially demonstrated by Liu Neng’s act of leaking critical information to Xie Dajiao, enabling her to evade surveillance by Li Fu—a move that underscores their mutual interest in circumventing external threats. This strategic coordination highlights a level of trust and tactical alignment, suggesting that they operate as a coordinated unit within a larger power struggle. However, this partnership is not without internal tension. Xie Dajiao, in turn, misinforms Liu Neng about the true condition of Zhao Yutian, a key figure in their shared narrative. This act of deception introduces emotional conflict into their relationship, as Liu Neng likely experiences betrayal or confusion upon realizing the misinformation, especially if Zhao Yutian’s well-being holds personal or strategic significance. The contradiction between their cooperative actions and Xie Dajiao’s deceit reveals a dynamic where alliances are maintained not through transparency, but through calculated manipulation and mutual benefit. Despite the emotional strain caused by the misrepresentation, the continued existence of their alliance—evidenced by Liu Neng’s actions—suggests that their strategic goals outweigh the personal rifts. This duality defines their relationship: a fragile yet functional partnership built on shared objectives, where trust is conditional, and information serves both as a weapon and a lifeline. The interplay between loyalty and deception positions Xie Dajiao and Liu Neng as pivotal figures in a network of intrigue, where each action is weighed against potential risks and rewards. Their evolving bond reflects the broader themes of survival and strategy within their environment, where personal feelings are often subordinated to larger political or survival imperatives. Ultimately, Xie Dajiao and Liu Neng represent a high-stakes alliance characterized by strategic coordination, emotional tension, and the constant negotiation of trust, all of which shape their roles and influence within the unfolding narrative.\",17\n102,WANG MOSHENG,XIE DAJIAO,\"Wang Mosheng unexpectedly becomes interested in Xie Dajiao during a failed marriage arrangement, leading to a new romantic possibility\",9\n70,LIU YISHUI,XIE XIAOMEI,\"Liu Yishui and Xie Xiaomei share a complex and strained relationship marked by misunderstandings and emotional distance. The deterioration of their bond begins when Liu Yishui fails to visit Xie Xiaomei during a time when she feigns illness, a moment that deeply affects her emotionally. This absence is perceived by Xie Xiaomei as a sign of neglect and indifference, leading her to grow increasingly distant from Liu Yishui. Compounding the tension, Xie Xiaomei becomes upset with Liu Yishui due to her belief that he is romantically involved with Wang Xiaomeng, a third party whose presence intensifies the interpersonal conflict between them. This perceived romantic entanglement fuels Xie Xiaomei’s sense of betrayal and insecurity, further straining their relationship. Despite no explicit confirmation of a romantic relationship between Liu Yishui and Wang Xiaomeng, Xie Xiaomei’s suspicions are strong enough to cause meaningful emotional rifts. The situation reflects a breakdown in communication and trust, where Liu Yishui’s actions—particularly his absence during a vulnerable moment—are interpreted through the lens of emotional abandonment and infidelity. Xie Xiaomei’s emotional response is rooted not only in the immediate incident of his non-visit but also in the broader context of her growing doubts about Liu Yishui’s loyalty. The conflict between the two is thus not isolated to a single event but is the result of cumulative emotional stress, miscommunication, and the psychological impact of perceived betrayal. Ultimately, their relationship is characterized by mutual emotional withdrawal, with Xie Xiaomei retreating emotionally due to feelings of neglect and suspicion, while Liu Yishui may remain unaware of the full extent of the impact of his actions. The dynamic between Liu Yishui and Xie Xiaomei underscores the fragility of personal relationships when trust is compromised and emotional needs are unmet.\",6\n158,XIE XIAOMEI,LIU YISHUI,\"Xie Xiaomei and Liu Yishui were previously involved, and their relationship is rekindled after her return\nLiu Yishui misses Xie Xiaomei and later reunites with her using a flower car, indicating a strong emotional bond\",6\n34,THE HOSPITAL VISIT AND MISTAKE,THE MISUNDERSTANDING AT THE HOUSE,\"Both events involve miscommunication and emotional fallout, contributing to the central drama between Xie Yongqiang and Wang Xiaomeng\",5\n100,WANG DALI,WANG MOSHENG,Wang Dali is the father of Wang Mosheng and is involved in the marriage plan with Wang Xiaomeng,4\n159,XIE XIAOMEI,XIE XIAOMEI'S FARM,\"Xie Xiaomei manages the farm, which becomes chaotic after her departure and later revived\",4\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
