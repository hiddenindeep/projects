The Forest is also a site of significant interpersonal events: Changgui intends to meet Xie Dajiao there to discuss a marriage proposal, and Xie Yongqiang later runs toward it to reunite with Wang Xiaomeng. These moments underscore the Forest’s role as a sacred space for decision-making and emotional resolution.

This effort is directly supported by her financial investment in hiring Wang Bing, which accelerates the mountain project. The Factory becomes a site of emotional intensity when Xie Yongqiang witnesses Wang Xiaomeng with Liu Yishui, triggering a crisis of trust and deepening his internal conflict. The scene underscores how personal relationships are intertwined with economic and social activities, and how public spaces can become stages for private emotional drama.

The choice of the Forest as the meeting place for this arrangement underscores the symbolic weight of the location, where personal and familial decisions converge.

A recent university graduate, Xie Yongqiang returns home to await his job assignment, marking a pivotal transition from academic life to adult responsibilities. Upon his return, he publicly reveals his romantic relationship with Wang Xiaomeng, signaling his commitment to love amid societal expectations. This decision places him at the center of emotional and familial tensions, particularly as he is pressured by Changgui to marry Xiangxiu, a woman with whom he develops feelings after visiting Liu Yishui’s clinic. His emotional conflict is central to his character arc: torn between familial duty and personal affection, Xie Yongqiang finds himself caught between two women—Xiangxiu, whom he is expected to marry, and Wang Xiaomeng, the woman he truly loves.\n\nInitially isolated and focused on practical matters, Xie Yongqiang is depicted as someone who is thoughtful and introspective, deeply considering his choices and their consequences. His journey takes a significant turn when he decides to work on opening a mountain, a symbolic act of personal and communal progress. This effort ultimately leads to his success in passing a civil service examination, marking a transition from a rural villager to a civil servant and indicating his growth and ambition. His transformation reflects broader themes of upward mobility and the tension between tradition and modernity in contemporary Chinese rural life.\n\nXie Yongqiang’s emotional depth is most poignantly illustrated when he runs toward the hill to find Wang Xiaomeng, a powerful visual representation of his determination to follow his heart despite external pressures. This moment encapsulates his internal struggle and his commitment to authenticity and emotional truth. While his relationship with Xiangxiu arises from social obligation and familial expectation, his connection with Wang Xiaomeng is rooted in genuine affection and mutual understanding. The narrative carefully balances these relationships, portraying Xie Yongqiang not as a man driven by fleeting desires, but as one navigating complex social dynamics with integrity and emotional maturity.\n\nIn summary, Xie Yongqiang is a deeply layered character whose journey reflects the challenges of love, duty, and self-discovery. Portrayed by He Shufeng with nuance and depth, he evolves from a reserved graduate to a civil servant who, despite societal pressures, ultimately chooses emotional authenticity. His story is one of personal growth, romantic conflict, and the enduring search for meaning in a world shaped by tradition and change.\",15\n125,WANG BING,\"Wang Bing is a character who helps Xie Yongqiang by providing a bulldozer, which accelerates the mountain opening process\",2\n22,THE RECONCILIATION EFFORTS,An event where Xie Yongqiang attempts to reconcile with Wang Xiaomeng after the misunderstanding,1\n50,THE TOFU FACTORY,The workshop where Wang Xiaomeng operates her tofu business and attempts to expand using an electric grinder,1\n127,QI SANTA,\"Qi Satai is a character portrayed by Wang Xiaoxi; he encourages Xie Yongqiang to take the civil service exam, which becomes a turning point in his life\",1\n79,FOREST,\"The FOREST is a significant and multifaceted location within the narrative, representing both natural and symbolic transformation. Originally a mountainous region that has undergone clearing, the FOREST now serves as a cultivated landscape where fruit trees are planted, signifying new beginnings and the promise of future prosperity. This agricultural renewal reflects a broader theme of rebirth and hope, suggesting that what was once wild and untamed has been reshaped into a productive and meaningful space. The planting of fruit trees underscores themes of growth, sustenance, and long-term vision, positioning the FOREST as a place of potential and promise.\n\nBeyond its agricultural and symbolic role, the FOREST is also a site of personal and emotional significance. It is the designated meeting place where Changgui intends to meet Xie Dajiao to discuss a marriage proposal, marking it as a location of pivotal interpersonal decisions. The choice of this particular woodland for such an important conversation highlights its quiet, secluded nature, offering privacy and a sense of intimacy. Notably, Xie Dajiao arrives at the meeting site already in makeup, suggesting a deliberate effort to present herself with care and dignity. This detail adds depth to her character, indicating anticipation, emotional preparation, and perhaps a sense of ceremony around the occasion.\n\nThe dual nature of the FOREST—both as a symbol of renewal and a stage for personal milestones—creates a rich, layered setting. It bridges the natural world with human aspiration, where the growth of fruit trees mirrors the potential for a flourishing relationship. The clearing of the mountain and subsequent reforestation with fruit trees may also be interpreted as an allegory for personal or societal transformation, where past challenges give way to new opportunities.\n\nIn sum, the FOREST stands as a dynamic and meaningful entity: a reclaimed landscape symbolizing hope and abundance, and a private space where key human connections unfold. Its role in the story is both literal and metaphorical, embodying the intersection of nature, renewal, and love. Through its dual function as a site of agricultural rebirth and emotional convergence, the FOREST becomes a powerful backdrop for both individual destiny and collective optimism.\",1\n141,MORNING LIGHT,\"Morning light is described as a setting element in the scene, illuminating Wang Xiaomeng as she works in the orchard\",1\n4,XIANGXIU,\"Xiangxiu is a woman portrayed by Wang Junping in the narrative, depicted as the daughter of Village Chief Changgui and a dedicated village health worker.

Xiangxiu harbors a strong desire to leave her rural village and move to the city, suggesting a yearning for a different life, greater opportunities, and possibly a break from the traditional constraints of village life. As a health worker, she plays a vital role in her community, contributing to public well-being and demonstrating responsibility and compassion. Her dual identity—as a daughter of a village leader and a frontline healthcare provider—positions her as a figure of both influence and service within her local environment. The evolution of her relationship with Xie Guangkun underscores themes of personal change, emotional depth, and the transformative power of human connection. The portrayal by Wang Junping brings nuance and authenticity to the character, highlighting her inner conflicts, aspirations, and emotional journey.

Xie Yongqiang struggles with conflicting emotions, especially after witnessing Wang Xiaomeng in close proximity to Liu Yishui, an encounter that intensifies his inner turmoil and casts doubt on his own feelings. This moment becomes a pivotal point in his emotional journey, exacerbating the existing strain in his engagement to Xiangxiu, whom he is formally committed to. The emotional conflict between his duty to his family and his genuine affection for Wang Xiaomeng creates a profound sense of inner division. Despite the societal and familial expectations pushing him toward a conventional path with Xiangxiu, Xie Yongqiang’s growing attachment to Wang Xiaomeng challenges his sense of identity and loyalty. Their relationship is thus portrayed not only as a romantic entanglement but also as a test of personal integrity and emotional truth. The narrative emphasizes the difficulty of choosing between love and obligation, with Xie Yongqiang’s internal struggle reflecting broader themes of autonomy, familial pressure, and the pursuit of authentic connection.
