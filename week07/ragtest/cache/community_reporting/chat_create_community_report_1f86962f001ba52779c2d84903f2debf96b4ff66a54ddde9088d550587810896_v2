The failure and success of these arrangements often hinge on deception—such as Liu Neng’s false claims about Wang Damao or Xie Dajiao’s misrepresentation of Zhao Yutian’s health—further illustrating how personal relationships are manipulated to serve broader agendas.

Portrayed by actor Wang Xiaobao, Changgui plays a central role in shaping the social and familial dynamics within the community. A man deeply invested in his family’s future, he actively seeks favorable matches for his daughter Xiangxiu, notably inviting Xie Yongqiang to dinner in an effort to cultivate a potential romantic relationship between Xie and Xiangxiu. This initiative underscores his commitment to securing a suitable future for his daughter through strategic social arrangements. In parallel, Changgui is also involved in other matrimonial efforts, having previously proposed to Wang Xiaomeng and later being considered as a potential match for Qi Santai’s sister, Wang Yun. These multiple attempts at arranged marriages highlight Changgui’s active role in navigating village relationships and his personal investment in familial alliances. Though his actions are driven by familial and communal expectations, they reveal a complex character caught between personal desires and societal pressures. Despite the overlapping narratives surrounding his role in marriage arrangements, the portrayal remains coherent: Changgui is a village leader and father who uses his influence and social standing to pursue advantageous matches for his family, reflecting the traditional values and interpersonal intricacies of rural life. His dual identity as both a leader and a father imbues his character with depth and significance, making him a pivotal figure in the unfolding story. Overall, Changgui emerges as a determined, involved, and socially engaged individual whose actions are shaped by the expectations of his community and his devotion to his family.\",6\n12,LIU NENG,\"Liu Neng is a complex and manipulative character portrayed by Wang Xiaoli in the narrative. He serves as a matchmaker within the community, leveraging emotional manipulation to influence personal relationships for his own benefit. Initially, Liu Neng appears to act as a facilitator in romantic and familial matters—most notably helping Li Fu make the decision to divorce and arranging a marriage for his daughter, Liu Ying. However, his role extends far beyond that of a mere matchmaker, as he is revealed to be a scheming villager who actively interferes in others' relationships for personal gain. He sabotages Zhao Yutian’s romantic attempts, demonstrating a pattern of malicious behavior aimed at disrupting relationships he disapproves of or finds inconvenient. Liu Neng also engages in deceitful actions, such as leaking sensitive information to Xie Dajiao to help her evade surveillance, thereby undermining community oversight. Furthermore, he falsely claims credit for establishing contact with Wang Damao, displaying a tendency to take undue credit for others' efforts.\n\nAs Liu Ying’s father, Liu Neng’s actions are deeply influenced by his desire to control his daughter’s future. Initially, he seeks to break off her engagement, misled by Xie Dajiao’s false information about Zhao Yutian’s injury status. This decision reveals a self-serving and emotionally manipulative nature, as he allows misinformation to guide his choices, prioritizing his own perception of advantage over his daughter’s happiness. His behavior underscores a consistent pattern of using deception and emotional manipulation to shape outcomes in his favor, often at the expense of others’ well-being.\n\nDespite his outward role as a matchmaker, Liu Neng’s actions are consistently driven by personal ambition, jealousy, and a desire for control. His interference in both romantic relationships and community affairs, coupled with his tendency to lie, misrepresent, and exploit others’ vulnerabilities, paints a portrait of a deeply manipulative and morally ambiguous figure. Ultimately, Liu Neng emerges as a pivotal antagonist whose actions ripple through the lives of multiple characters, driving conflict and tension within the community. His character serves as a cautionary figure, illustrating the dangers of emotional manipulation and the consequences of allowing personal agendas to override integrity and honesty.\",9\n6,XIE DAJIAO,\"Xie Dajiao is a multifaceted and pivotal character in the narrative, portrayed by actress Yu Yuexian. She is a respected villager and aunt to Li Daguo, serving as a key intermediary within the community. Her role extends beyond familial ties; she actively mediates relationships and engages in subtle political maneuvering, often acting as a linchpin in the village’s social and power dynamics. Xie Dajiao is deeply involved in secret information exchange, a fact that renders her a figure of significance and discretion. Her ability to operate under the radar is safeguarded by leaks from Liu Neng, which shield her from surveillance and allow her to maintain influence behind the scenes.\n\nInitially married to Li Fu, Xie Dajiao endures a marital conflict that strains their relationship. However, the narrative ultimately resolves this tension, culminating in a reconciliation between Xie Dajiao and Li Fu, reaffirming their bond despite prior discord. This personal arc underscores her emotional depth and resilience. In parallel, Xie Dajiao becomes unexpectedly courted by Wang Dali during a failed marriage arrangement, marking a pivotal moment in her personal journey and introducing a layer of romantic tension.\n\nHer influence extends to the next generation, as she plays a crucial role in connecting Li Daguo to Wang Xiaomeng, facilitating key relationships within the village network. Later, she becomes a significant romantic interest for Wang Mosheng, highlighting her evolving emotional and social status. Additionally, she supports Xie Xiaomei, contributing to her development and serving as a mentor figure in times of need.\n\nThrough her numerous roles—family matriarch, political influencer, secret agent, and romantic lead—Xie Dajiao emerges as a central figure whose actions ripple across the community. Her complexity, loyalty, and strategic acumen make her indispensable to the narrative. Portrayed with nuance by Yu Yuexian, Xie Dajiao embodies the intertwining of personal relationships, political intrigue, and moral resilience in the village’s evolving social fabric.\",6\n42,ZHANG GUI,Zhang Gui is a man who pressures Xie Yongqiang to formally marry Xiangxiu and is involved in various interpersonal conflicts; he is also involved in village politics and tries to manipulate situations to his advantage,3\n123,YU TIAN,Yu Tian is a character portrayed by Wu Yunfei; he is engaged to Liu Ying and eventually marries her after a series of misunderstandings and comedic situations,2\n45,WANG DALAO,\"Wang Damao is a powerful village figure who is approached by Liu Neng, who falsely claims to have secured a connection with him, leading to a reward from Zhang Gui\",1\n43,LI FU,\"Li Fu is a complex character involved in a turbulent narrative centered around Xie Dajiao. Initially, he is portrayed as a man deeply entangled in a strained relationship with Xie Dajiao, one that evolves from hesitation to decisive action. Although he harbors an internal desire to divorce her, he initially struggles with the decision, reflecting emotional conflict and uncertainty. His resolve shifts under external influence, particularly from Liu Neng, who ultimately pushes him to choose to leave Xie Dajiao behind, marking a pivotal turning point in his personal journey.\n\nFurther context reveals that Li Fu’s role extends beyond that of a passive spouse. He is also a man assigned by authorities to monitor Xie Dajiao, suggesting he may have been involved in some form of surveillance or state-imposed oversight. This dual identity—as both a personal figure in a domestic conflict and a state agent—adds layers of tension and ambiguity to his character. His involvement in monitoring Xie Dajiao likely contributes to the growing distrust and animosity between them, culminating in his arrest by the police.\n\nAfter his arrest, Li Fu is released by Zhang Gui, a figure who appears to hold significant authority or influence. However, despite this release, he is not permitted to enter Zhang Gui’s home by Xie Dajiao, underscoring her continued control over certain spaces and relationships. This exclusion emphasizes the power dynamics at play and suggests that Xie Dajiao maintains a strong grip on her environment, even after Li Fu’s official release and personal decision to sever ties.\n\nIn summary, Li Fu is a man torn between personal desire and external pressures, caught between his emotional attachment to Xie Dajiao, his duty as a monitor, and the influence of others like Liu Neng and Zhang Gui. His journey—from hesitation to decision, from arrest to release, and from a participant in a marital relationship to a figure barred from a space once shared—reveals a man navigating a web of power, surveillance, and personal transformation. Though his actions reflect a move toward autonomy, his fate remains constrained by the individuals and systems surrounding him. Li Fu’s story is one of internal conflict, external manipulation, and the difficult pursuit of independence in a world where trust is fragile and boundaries are fiercely guarded.\",4\n129,LIU NENG'S HOUSE,\"A residence where Liu Neng and his wife live, described as becoming quiet after Liu Ying’s wedding\",1\n76,WANG YUN,\"Wang Yun is Qi Santai’s sister, who is proposed to by Changgui.

He is pleased when Wang Mosheng meets Xie Dajiao and later proposes a marriage to her. He is portrayed by a character in the drama.,2\n11,LIU YING,\"Liu Ying is a character portrayed by Jiang Yishan in a romantic narrative that unfolds through a series of comedic and emotionally charged events. Initially presented as the fiancée of Zhao Yutian, Liu Ying is deeply involved in a relationship with him, and her storyline includes plans to visit him in the hospital, indicating a significant emotional and personal connection. However, the narrative evolves as Liu Ying becomes romantically entangled with Yu Tian. Over the course of the story, the relationship between Liu Ying and Yu Tian develops through a series of humorous and dramatic moments, ultimately culminating in their marriage. This shift from her original engagement to Zhao Yutian to a committed union with Yu Tian resolves the apparent contradiction between the two descriptions: while Liu Ying is formally engaged to Zhao Yutian, the progression of her romantic arc leads her to choose Yu Tian, resulting in a new life partnership. The character of Liu Ying thus embodies a transformation from a woman bound by duty and anticipation of a traditional engagement to one who embraces love and personal choice, driven by genuine emotional connection. Her journey reflects themes of destiny, comedy, and the complexities of modern romance, where personal fulfillment often overrides societal expectations. The portrayal by Jiang Yishan brings nuance and charm to the role, balancing light-hearted moments with heartfelt emotion. In the end, Liu Ying’s story is one of love discovered in unexpected places, where comedic misunderstandings and emotional growth lead to a meaningful and lasting union with Yu Tian, marking her as a central figure in a dynamic and evolving love narrative.\",2\n75,QI SANTAI,\"Qi Santai is a villager who pressures Changgui to act, introduces his sister to Changgui, and is involved in marital arrangements.

Their alliance is initially demonstrated by Liu Neng’s act of leaking critical information to Xie Dajiao, enabling her to evade surveillance by Li Fu—a move that underscores their mutual interest in circumventing external threats. This strategic coordination highlights a level of trust and tactical alignment, suggesting that they operate as a coordinated unit within a larger power struggle. However, this partnership is not without internal tension. Xie Dajiao, in turn, misinforms Liu Neng about the true condition of Zhao Yutian, a key figure in their shared narrative. This act of deception introduces emotional conflict into their relationship, as Liu Neng likely experiences betrayal or confusion upon realizing the misinformation, especially if Zhao Yutian’s well-being holds personal or strategic significance. The contradiction between their cooperative actions and Xie Dajiao’s deceit reveals a dynamic where alliances are maintained not through transparency, but through calculated manipulation and mutual benefit. Despite the emotional strain caused by the misrepresentation, the continued existence of their alliance—evidenced by Liu Neng’s actions—suggests that their strategic goals outweigh the personal rifts. This duality defines their relationship: a fragile yet functional partnership built on shared objectives, where trust is conditional, and information serves both as a weapon and a lifeline.
