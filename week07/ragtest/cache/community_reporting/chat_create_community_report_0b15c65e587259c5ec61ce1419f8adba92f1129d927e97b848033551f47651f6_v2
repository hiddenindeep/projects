She is a young woman from the same village as Xie Yongqiang, with whom she shares a romantic relationship. Their bond is both emotional and supportive—Wang Xiaomeng provides Xie Yongqiang with crucial financial and emotional backing, including funding a bulldozer to aid his endeavors. The two ultimately share a heartfelt reunion at an orchard, symbolizing the enduring nature of their connection. Despite this, their relationship is tested by external developments, particularly as Wang Xiaomeng becomes involved in a parallel romantic subplot with Liu Yishui.\n\nThis emotional shift arises from her efforts to expand her tofu factory, a significant personal and economic venture. Initially, she installs an electric grinder to increase production, but the change results in a decline in tofu quality. To resolve this, she seeks help from Liu Yishui, a skilled mechanic, leading to a close working relationship that evolves into emotional intimacy. This dynamic causes tension with Xie Yongqiang, who feels betrayed and sidelined, highlighting the complexities of love and loyalty within the village community. The evolving romantic entanglements underscore her role as a woman caught between tradition and personal desire.\n\nWang Xiaomeng is also depicted as a woman subjected to multiple arranged marriage attempts, including one with Wang Mosheng, which she initially resists. Her journey reflects broader social pressures and the struggle for autonomy in a traditional setting. Despite these challenges, she emerges as a resilient and resourceful individual, navigating both personal and communal expectations. Her absence from a key gathering at her home underscores her withdrawal from certain social dynamics, possibly due to emotional turmoil. Later, she is seen working in the orchard—possibly a place of reflection or reconciliation—signaling a return to a pivotal space in her relationship with Xie Yongqiang and a symbol of renewal.\n\nOverall, Wang Xiaomeng is a complex figure whose story intertwines romance, economic ambition, familial obligation, and personal growth. Through her actions and relationships, she emerges as a pivotal force in shaping the emotional and social landscape of the village, portrayed with depth and nuance by Wang Yabin.\",17\n238,RECIPE OF ADMISSION NOTICE,The event of the admission notice being carried by Xie Yongqiang and fluttering in the air symbolizes a pivotal moment of anticipation and emotional tension,2\n239,GATHERING AT HOME,\"A gathering takes place at Wang Xiaomeng's home, where people are assembled, but she is notably absent\",2\n7,LI DAGUO,Li Daguo is the cousin of Xie Dajiao and is arranged to meet Wang Xiaomeng in a marriage arrangement; portrayed by Wang Xiaohu,1\n25,THE FARMHOUSE OF WANG LAOQI,The home of Wang Laoqi where Wang Xiaomeng is taken after being rejected by Xie Guangkun,1\n65,THE ELECTRIC GRINDER INSTALLATION AND REMOVAL,\"Wang Xiaomeng installs an electric grinder to expand her tofu production, but the quality declines, leading her to remove it; this event marks a turning point in her business efforts\",1\n232,WANG XIAOMENG'S FERMENTED TOFU STALL,\"A recurring activity where Wang Xiaomeng runs her tofu business, symbolizing her resilience and daily contribution to the community\nA daily activity in the story where Wang Xiaomeng runs her tofu business, symbolizing her persistence and contribution to the community\",1\n235,WANG XIAOMENG AND XIE YONGQIANG'S FINAL MEETING,\"The emotional climax where Xie Yongqiang runs to Wang Xiaomeng in the orchard upon receiving his civil service acceptance, symbolizing love and acceptance\nThe emotional climax where Xie Yongqiang runs to meet Wang Xiaomeng in the orchard upon receiving his civil service acceptance, symbolizing their love and acceptance\",1\n21,THE MISUNDERSTANDING AT THE HOUSE,\"An event where Wang Xiaomeng sees Xie Yongqiang and Xiangxiu together, leading to emotional distress and conflict\",3\n236,ORCHARD,The orchard is a location where Wang Xiaomeng is working in the morning light,2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n4,XIE YONGQIANG,THE RECONCILIATION EFFORTS,\"Xie Yongqiang attempts to reconcile with Wang Xiaomeng after the misunderstandings, showing ongoing emotional investment\",22\n8,WANG XIAOMENG,XIE GUANGKUN,\"Xie Guangkun rejects Wang Xiaomeng due to her family background, creating tension between the families\",19\n164,WANG XIAOMENG,RECIPE OF ADMISSION NOTICE,\"The admission notice is directly related to Wang Xiaomeng, as it is likely meant for her, and her absence at home suggests its significance to her future\",19\n165,WANG XIAOMENG,GATHERING AT HOME,\"Wang Xiaomeng is absent from the gathering at her home, which is a key point of emotional tension in the scene\",19\n10,WANG XIAOMENG,LI DAGUO,Li Daguo is arranged to meet Wang Xiaomeng in a marriage arrangement after Xie Yongqiang’s relationship with her deteriorates,18\n14,WANG XIAOMENG,THE FARMHOUSE OF WANG LAOQI,Wang Xiaomeng is taken to this house by her father after being rejected by Xie Guangkun,18\n63,WANG XIAOMENG,THE ELECTRIC GRINDER INSTALLATION AND REMOVAL,Wang Xiaomeng installs and later removes an electric grinder from her tofu factory due to declining product quality,18\n147,WANG XIAOMENG,WANG XIAOMENG'S FERMENTED TOFU STALL,\"Wang Xiaomeng runs her tofu stall daily, which is a symbol of her resilience and contribution to the community\",18\n148,WANG XIAOMENG,WANG XIAOMENG AND XIE YONGQIANG'S FINAL MEETING,\"Their final meeting at dawn in the orchard is the emotional climax of the story, where love is affirmed\",18\n35,THE MISUNDERSTANDING AT THE HOUSE,THE RECONCILIATION EFFORTS,\"After the misunderstanding, Xie Yongqiang attempts to reconcile with Wang Xiaomeng, showing the emotional continuity of their relationship\",5\n169,ORCHARD,HILL,\"The hill and orchard are spatially connected locations—Xie Yongqiang runs from the hill toward the orchard, where Wang Xiaomeng is working\",4\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
