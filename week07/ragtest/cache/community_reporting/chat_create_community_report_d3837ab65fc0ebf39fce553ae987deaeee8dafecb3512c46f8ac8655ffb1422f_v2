Initially depicted as a recent university graduate returning home to await job assignment, Xie Yongqiang is a diligent and thoughtful young man navigating the complexities of rural life, family expectations, and romantic entanglements. His journey begins in a rural village, where he is emotionally isolated but determined to build a better future. He is portrayed as a hardworking individual who eventually takes on the challenging task of opening a mountain—a symbolic and literal effort to transform his environment and secure a livelihood.\n\nThroughout the series, Xie Yongqiang faces significant emotional and social pressures. He is pressured by Changgui to marry Xiangxiu, a woman he encounters while visiting Liu Yishui in the clinic, where he develops feelings for her. This creates a significant source of internal conflict, as Xie Yongqiang is also deeply emotionally connected to Wang Xiaomeng. The tension between duty and desire defines much of his character arc. Despite the external pressure to conform to familial and social expectations, he ultimately chooses to follow his heart, publicly revealing his romantic relationship with Wang Xiaomeng, demonstrating his courage and integrity.\n\nA pivotal moment in the narrative occurs when Xie Yongqiang, overwhelmed by the weight of his decisions and emotions, chooses to act on his feelings. He thinks deeply about his situation and runs toward the hill to find Wang Xiaomeng, symbolizing his commitment to love and personal authenticity. This moment underscores his emotional maturity and the resolve that drives him forward.\n\nXie Yongqiang’s journey takes a transformative turn when he takes and successfully passes the civil service exam, marking a significant step toward personal achievement and upward mobility. His perseverance and determination culminate in a touching reunion with Wang Xiaomeng, signifying the fulfillment of both his personal and romantic aspirations. As a civil servant, he transitions from a rural villager into a figure of hope and progress, embodying the series’ themes of resilience, moral clarity, and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nIn summary, Xie Yongqiang is a multifaceted character whose story blends familial duty, romantic conflict, and personal ambition. Portrayed with nuance by He Shufeng, he emerges as a symbol of integrity, emotional courage, and the enduring power of love amidst adversity.\",20\n1,WANG XIAOMENG,\"Wang Xiaomeng, portrayed by Wang Yabin, is a central and multifaceted character in the narrative, deeply rooted in the life of her village and intricately connected to several key figures. She is a young woman from the same village as Xie Yongqiang, with whom she shares a romantic relationship. Their bond is both emotional and supportive—Wang Xiaomeng provides Xie Yongqiang with crucial financial and emotional backing, including funding a bulldozer to aid his endeavors. The two ultimately share a heartfelt reunion at an orchard, symbolizing the enduring nature of their connection. Despite this, their relationship is tested by external developments, particularly as Wang Xiaomeng becomes involved in a parallel romantic subplot with Liu Yishui.\n\nThis emotional shift arises from her efforts to expand her tofu factory, a significant personal and economic venture. Initially, she installs an electric grinder to increase production, but the change results in a decline in tofu quality. To resolve this, she seeks help from Liu Yishui, a skilled mechanic, leading to a close working relationship that evolves into emotional intimacy. This dynamic causes tension with Xie Yongqiang, who feels betrayed and sidelined, highlighting the complexities of love and loyalty within the village community. The evolving romantic entanglements underscore her role as a woman caught between tradition and personal desire.\n\nWang Xiaomeng is also depicted as a woman subjected to multiple arranged marriage attempts, including one with Wang Mosheng, which she initially resists. Her journey reflects broader social pressures and the struggle for autonomy in a traditional setting. Despite these challenges, she emerges as a resilient and resourceful individual, navigating both personal and communal expectations. Her absence from a key gathering at her home underscores her withdrawal from certain social dynamics, possibly due to emotional turmoil. Later, she is seen working in the orchard—possibly a place of reflection or reconciliation—signaling a return to a pivotal space in her relationship with Xie Yongqiang and a symbol of renewal.\n\nOverall, Wang Xiaomeng is a complex figure whose story intertwines romance, economic ambition, familial obligation, and personal growth.

It is a wooded area where Changgui plans to meet Xie Dajiao to discuss a marriage proposal, marking it as a site of personal and emotional importance. In this context, the FOREST becomes a place of anticipation and transformation, heightened by the detail that Xie Dajiao arrives there adorned in makeup, suggesting a moment of ritualistic significance and emotional weight tied to the encounter.\n\nBeyond its immediate role in the personal drama between Changgui and Xie Dajiao, the FOREST also carries broader symbolic meaning. Following the clearing of the mountain, the area is repurposed for agriculture, with fruit trees being planted across the landscape. This transformation signifies new beginnings and a hopeful vision for future prosperity, reflecting a shift from wilderness to cultivated order. The planting of fruit trees implies not only economic renewal but also ecological and social renewal—a deliberate effort to reclaim and steward the land for sustainable growth and communal well-being.\n\nThus, the FOREST embodies dual narratives: one intimate and emotional, centered on human relationships and personal decisions, and another expansive and allegorical, representing resilience, rebirth, and the promise of a better future. The convergence of these meanings elevates the FOREST from a mere backdrop to a living symbol of change—where individual hopes intersect with collective aspirations. The act of planting fruit trees after deforestation underscores a conscious effort to heal and regenerate, turning what may have once been a wild, untamed space into a productive and meaningful landscape.\n\nIn sum, the FOREST is not only the chosen meeting ground for a pivotal romantic discussion but also a powerful emblem of renewal and progress, shaped by both human intention and natural transformation. Its dual identity—personal and symbolic—ensures that it remains a central, layered site in the story’s emotional and thematic arc.\",1\n222,WANG BING,\"Wang Bing is a character who assists Xie Yongqiang by providing a bulldozer to speed up the mountain-clearing process, funded by Wang Xiaomeng\nWang Bing is a character who helps Xie Yongqiang by providing a bulldozer, which accelerates the mountain opening process\",2\n238,RECIPE OF ADMISSION NOTICE,The event of the admission notice being carried by Xie Yongqiang and fluttering in the air symbolizes a pivotal moment of anticipation and emotional tension,2\n239,GATHERING AT HOME,\"A gathering takes place at Wang Xiaomeng's home, where people are assembled, but she is notably absent\",2\n7,LI DAGUO,Li Daguo is the cousin of Xie Dajiao and is arranged to meet Wang Xiaomeng in a marriage arrangement; portrayed by Wang Xiaohu,1\n25,THE FARMHOUSE OF WANG LAOQI,The home of Wang Laoqi where Wang Xiaomeng is taken after being rejected by Xie Guangkun,1\n65,THE ELECTRIC GRINDER INSTALLATION AND REMOVAL,\"Wang Xiaomeng installs an electric grinder to expand her tofu production, but the quality declines, leading her to remove it; this event marks a turning point in her business efforts\",1\n232,WANG XIAOMENG'S FERMENTED TOFU STALL,\"A recurring activity where Wang Xiaomeng runs her tofu business, symbolizing her resilience and daily contribution to the community\nA daily activity in the story where Wang Xiaomeng runs her tofu business, symbolizing her persistence and contribution to the community\",1\n235,WANG XIAOMENG AND XIE YONGQIANG'S FINAL MEETING,\"The emotional climax where Xie Yongqiang runs to Wang Xiaomeng in the orchard upon receiving his civil service acceptance, symbolizing love and acceptance\nThe emotional climax where Xie Yongqiang runs to meet Wang Xiaomeng in the orchard upon receiving his civil service acceptance, symbolizing their love and acceptance\",1\n4,XIANGXIU,\"Xiangxiu is a woman portrayed by Wang Junping in the narrative, serving as the daughter of Village Chief Changgui and working as a village health worker. She initially presents a cold and distant demeanor toward Xie Guangkun, reflecting a reserved and cautious attitude. However, over the course of the story, her attitude toward him evolves significantly, shifting from aloofness to a more open and warmer disposition, indicating personal growth and changing emotional dynamics. Xiangxiu harbors a strong desire to leave the village and move to the city, driven by aspirations for a different life beyond her rural roots. This ambition underscores her yearning for personal advancement and a broader worldview, setting her apart from the traditional roles often expected in her community. Her professional role as a village health worker highlights her dedication to her community and her responsibility in maintaining public health in the village. As a central figure in the narrative, Xiangxiu's journey—from emotional reserve to greater emotional openness—serves as a key element in the evolving relationships within the story, particularly in her connection with Xie Guangkun. Her character embodies the tension between tradition and aspiration, rooted in her dual identity as both a local community figure and an individual with dreams of urban life.

Their bond is complicated by external pressures, particularly from Xie Yongqiang’s family, which disapproves of their relationship, adding layers of conflict and tension. Xie Yongqiang struggles with conflicting emotions, especially after witnessing Wang Xiaomeng in close proximity to Liu Yishui, an encounter that intensifies his inner turmoil and casts doubt on his own feelings. This moment becomes a pivotal point in his emotional journey, exacerbating the existing strain in his engagement to Xiangxiu, whom he is formally committed to. The emotional conflict between his duty to his family and his genuine affection for Wang Xiaomeng creates a profound sense of inner division. Despite the societal and familial expectations pushing him toward a conventional path with Xiangxiu, Xie Yongqiang’s growing attachment to Wang Xiaomeng challenges his sense of identity and loyalty.
