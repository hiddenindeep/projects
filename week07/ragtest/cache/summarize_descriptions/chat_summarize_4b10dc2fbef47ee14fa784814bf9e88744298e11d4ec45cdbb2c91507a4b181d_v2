She is a respected villager and aunt to Li Daguo, serving as a key intermediary within the community. Her role extends beyond familial ties; she actively mediates relationships and engages in subtle political maneuvering, often acting as a linchpin in the village’s social and power dynamics. Xie Dajiao is deeply involved in secret information exchange, a fact that renders her a figure of significance and discretion. Her ability to operate under the radar is safeguarded by leaks from Liu Neng, which shield her from surveillance and allow her to maintain influence behind the scenes.\n\nInitially married to Li Fu, Xie Dajiao endures a marital conflict that strains their relationship. However, the narrative ultimately resolves this tension, culminating in a reconciliation between Xie Dajiao and Li Fu, reaffirming their bond despite prior discord. This personal arc underscores her emotional depth and resilience. In parallel, Xie Dajiao becomes unexpectedly courted by Wang Dali during a failed marriage arrangement, marking a pivotal moment in her personal journey and introducing a layer of romantic tension.\n\nHer influence extends to the next generation, as she plays a crucial role in connecting Li Daguo to Wang Xiaomeng, facilitating key relationships within the village network. Later, she becomes a significant romantic interest for Wang Mosheng, highlighting her evolving emotional and social status. Additionally, she supports Xie Xiaomei, contributing to her development and serving as a mentor figure in times of need.\n\nThrough her numerous roles—family matriarch, political influencer, secret agent, and romantic lead—Xie Dajiao emerges as a central figure whose actions ripple across the community. Her complexity, loyalty, and strategic acumen make her indispensable to the narrative. Portrayed with nuance by Yu Yuexian, Xie Dajiao embodies the intertwining of personal relationships, political intrigue, and moral resilience in the village’s evolving social fabric.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758442784, "model": "qwen-flash", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 415, "prompt_tokens": 315, "total_tokens": 730, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
