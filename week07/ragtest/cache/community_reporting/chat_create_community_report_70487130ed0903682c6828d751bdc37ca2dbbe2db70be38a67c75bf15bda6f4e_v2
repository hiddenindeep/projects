Initially depicted as a recent university graduate returning home to await job assignment, Xie Yongqiang is a diligent and thoughtful young man navigating the complexities of rural life, family expectations, and romantic entanglements. His journey begins in a rural village, where he is emotionally isolated but determined to build a better future. He is portrayed as a hardworking individual who eventually takes on the challenging task of opening a mountain—a symbolic and literal effort to transform his environment and secure a livelihood.\n\nThroughout the series, Xie Yongqiang faces significant emotional and social pressures. He is pressured by Changgui to marry Xiangxiu, a woman he encounters while visiting Liu Yishui in the clinic, where he develops feelings for her. This creates a significant source of internal conflict, as Xie Yongqiang is also deeply emotionally connected to Wang Xiaomeng. The tension between duty and desire defines much of his character arc. Despite the external pressure to conform to familial and social expectations, he ultimately chooses to follow his heart, publicly revealing his romantic relationship with Wang Xiaomeng, demonstrating his courage and integrity.\n\nA pivotal moment in the narrative occurs when Xie Yongqiang, overwhelmed by the weight of his decisions and emotions, chooses to act on his feelings. He thinks deeply about his situation and runs toward the hill to find Wang Xiaomeng, symbolizing his commitment to love and personal authenticity. This moment underscores his emotional maturity and the resolve that drives him forward.\n\nXie Yongqiang’s journey takes a transformative turn when he takes and successfully passes the civil service exam, marking a significant step toward personal achievement and upward mobility. His perseverance and determination culminate in a touching reunion with Wang Xiaomeng, signifying the fulfillment of both his personal and romantic aspirations. As a civil servant, he transitions from a rural villager into a figure of hope and progress, embodying the series’ themes of resilience, moral clarity, and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nIn summary, Xie Yongqiang is a multifaceted character whose story blends familial duty, romantic conflict, and personal ambition. Portrayed with nuance by He Shufeng, he emerges as a symbol of integrity, emotional courage, and the enduring power of love amidst adversity.\",20\n4,XIANGXIU,\"Xiangxiu is a woman portrayed by Wang Junping in the narrative, serving as the daughter of Village Chief Changgui and working as a village health worker. She initially presents a cold and distant demeanor toward Xie Guangkun, reflecting a reserved and cautious attitude. However, over the course of the story, her attitude toward him evolves significantly, shifting from aloofness to a more open and warmer disposition, indicating personal growth and changing emotional dynamics. Xiangxiu harbors a strong desire to leave the village and move to the city, driven by aspirations for a different life beyond her rural roots. This ambition underscores her yearning for personal advancement and a broader worldview, setting her apart from the traditional roles often expected in her community. Her professional role as a village health worker highlights her dedication to her community and her responsibility in maintaining public health in the village. As a central figure in the narrative, Xiangxiu's journey—from emotional reserve to greater emotional openness—serves as a key element in the evolving relationships within the story, particularly in her connection with Xie Guangkun. Her character embodies the tension between tradition and aspiration, rooted in her dual identity as both a local community figure and an individual with dreams of urban life. Through her portrayal by Wang Junping, Xiangxiu emerges as a layered and compelling character, whose personal journey reflects broader themes of change, resilience, and the pursuit of self-fulfillment.\",3\n229,MOUNTAIN OPENING PROJECT,\"The project to clear the mountain, led by Xie Yongqiang with help from Wang Xiaomeng and Wang Bing, marking a key transformation in his life\nThe project to clear the mountain, initiated by Xie Yongqiang with help from Wang Xiaomeng and Wang Bing, which becomes a pivotal transformation in his life\",2\n231,XIE YONGQIANG'S CIVIL SERVICE EXAM,\"The event in which Xie Yongqiang takes the civil service exam after being encouraged by many, ultimately passing and securing a government position\",2\n240,HILL,The hill is the destination Xie Yongqiang runs toward in search of Wang Xiaomeng,2\n24,THE FARMHOUSE OF XIE YONGQIANG,The family home of Xie Yongqiang where initial conflicts arise over his relationship with Wang Xiaomeng,1\n60,THE TOFU FACTORY,The workshop where Wang Xiaomeng operates her tofu business and attempts to expand using an electric grinder,1\n224,QI SANTA,\"Qi Satai is a character portrayed by Wang Xiaoxi; he encourages Xie Yongqiang to take the civil service exam, which becomes a turning point in his life\",1\n93,FOREST,\"The FOREST is a significant and multifaceted location within the narrative, serving both as a literal setting and a symbolic space. It is a wooded area where Changgui plans to meet Xie Dajiao to discuss a marriage proposal, marking it as a site of personal and emotional importance. In this context, the FOREST becomes a place of anticipation and transformation, heightened by the detail that Xie Dajiao arrives there adorned in makeup, suggesting a moment of ritualistic significance and emotional weight tied to the encounter.\n\nBeyond its immediate role in the personal drama between Changgui and Xie Dajiao, the FOREST also carries broader symbolic meaning. Following the clearing of the mountain, the area is repurposed for agriculture, with fruit trees being planted across the landscape. This transformation signifies new beginnings and a hopeful vision for future prosperity, reflecting a shift from wilderness to cultivated order. The planting of fruit trees implies not only economic renewal but also ecological and social renewal—a deliberate effort to reclaim and steward the land for sustainable growth and communal well-being.\n\nThus, the FOREST embodies dual narratives: one intimate and emotional, centered on human relationships and personal decisions, and another expansive and allegorical, representing resilience, rebirth, and the promise of a better future. The convergence of these meanings elevates the FOREST from a mere backdrop to a living symbol of change—where individual hopes intersect with collective aspirations. The act of planting fruit trees after deforestation underscores a conscious effort to heal and regenerate, turning what may have once been a wild, untamed space into a productive and meaningful landscape.\n\nIn sum, the FOREST is not only the chosen meeting ground for a pivotal romantic discussion but also a powerful emblem of renewal and progress, shaped by both human intention and natural transformation. Its dual identity—personal and symbolic—ensures that it remains a central, layered site in the story’s emotional and thematic arc.\",1\n222,WANG BING,\"Wang Bing is a character who assists Xie Yongqiang by providing a bulldozer to speed up the mountain-clearing process, funded by Wang Xiaomeng\nWang Bing is a character who helps Xie Yongqiang by providing a bulldozer, which accelerates the mountain opening process\",2\n237,MORNING LIGHT,\"Morning light is described as a setting element in the scene, illuminating Wang Xiaomeng as she works in the orchard\",2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n0,XIE YONGQIANG,WANG XIAOMENG,\"Xie Yongqiang and Wang Xiaomeng are romantically involved, and their relationship serves as a central narrative thread in the story, marked by emotional intensity, familial opposition, and deep misunderstandings.

Xie Yongqiang struggles with conflicting emotions, especially after witnessing Wang Xiaomeng in close proximity to Liu Yishui, an encounter that intensifies his inner turmoil and casts doubt on his own feelings. This moment becomes a pivotal point in his emotional journey, exacerbating the existing strain in his engagement to Xiangxiu, whom he is formally committed to. The emotional conflict between his duty to his family and his genuine affection for Wang Xiaomeng creates a profound sense of inner division. Despite the societal and familial expectations pushing him toward a conventional path with Xiangxiu, Xie Yongqiang’s growing attachment to Wang Xiaomeng challenges his sense of identity and loyalty. Their relationship is thus portrayed not only as a romantic entanglement but also as a test of personal integrity and emotional truth. The narrative emphasizes the difficulty of choosing between love and obligation, with Xie Yongqiang’s internal struggle reflecting broader themes of autonomy, familial pressure, and the pursuit of authentic connection. Ultimately, the dynamic between Xie Yongqiang and Wang Xiaomeng is defined by passion, sacrifice, and the enduring impact of external judgment, making their journey a compelling exploration of love in the face of adversity.\",37\n2,XIE YONGQIANG,XIANGXIU,\"Xie Yongqiang and Xiangxiu share a complex and evolving relationship shaped by emotional entanglements and external pressures. Xie Yongqiang initially develops romantic feelings for Xiangxiu after meeting her in a clinic, marking the beginning of a significant emotional connection between them. However, their relationship is not without complications. Under pressure from Zhang Gui, Xie Yongqiang becomes engaged to Xiangxiu, a decision that reflects external influence rather than purely personal choice. This engagement is further complicated by Xie Yongqiang’s lingering emotional attachment to Wang Xiaomeng, which creates tension during the engagement ceremony. The presence of this unresolved affection undermines the authenticity of his commitment to Xiangxiu and sows seeds of doubt and conflict.\n\nThe situation intensifies when Xie Yongqiang is seen with Xiangxiu at a critical moment, a scene that is misinterpreted by Wang Xiaomeng. This incident deepens the rift between Xie Yongqiang and Wang Xiaomeng, who perceives his closeness to Xiangxiu as confirmation of his divided loyalties. The misunderstanding underscores the emotional strain caused by Xie Yongqiang’s conflicting feelings and highlights the fragile nature of trust in his relationships.\n\nDespite the complications, Xie Yongqiang’s bond with Xiangxiu remains a central dynamic. Their relationship evolves from a chance encounter into a formal engagement, though it is fraught with emotional inconsistency and external interference. While the narrative suggests that Xie Yongqiang is emotionally invested in Xiangxiu—particularly in moments of crisis—his unresolved feelings for Wang Xiaomeng cast uncertainty over the stability and sincerity of his commitment to Xiangxiu. The interplay of duty, pressure, and personal desire defines the trajectory of his relationship with Xiangxiu.\n\nUltimately, the interactions between Xie Yongqiang, Xiangxiu, and Wang Xiaomeng reveal a story of emotional conflict, external manipulation, and miscommunication.
