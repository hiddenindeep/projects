Initially, he is portrayed as a man deeply entangled in a strained relationship with Xie Dajiao, one that evolves from hesitation to decisive action. Although he harbors an internal desire to divorce her, he initially struggles with the decision, reflecting emotional conflict and uncertainty. His resolve shifts under external influence, particularly from Liu Neng, who ultimately pushes him to choose to leave Xie Dajiao behind, marking a pivotal turning point in his personal journey.\n\nFurther context reveals that Li Fu’s role extends beyond that of a passive spouse. He is also a man assigned by authorities to monitor Xie Dajiao, suggesting he may have been involved in some form of surveillance or state-imposed oversight. This dual identity—as both a personal figure in a domestic conflict and a state agent—adds layers of tension and ambiguity to his character. His involvement in monitoring Xie Dajiao likely contributes to the growing distrust and animosity between them, culminating in his arrest by the police.\n\nAfter his arrest, Li Fu is released by Zhang Gui, a figure who appears to hold significant authority or influence. However, despite this release, he is not permitted to enter Zhang Gui’s home by Xie Dajiao, underscoring her continued control over certain spaces and relationships. This exclusion emphasizes the power dynamics at play and suggests that Xie Dajiao maintains a strong grip on her environment, even after Li Fu’s official release and personal decision to sever ties.\n\nIn summary, Li Fu is a man torn between personal desire and external pressures, caught between his emotional attachment to Xie Dajiao, his duty as a monitor, and the influence of others like Liu Neng and Zhang Gui. His journey—from hesitation to decision, from arrest to release, and from a participant in a marital relationship to a figure barred from a space once shared—reveals a man navigating a web of power, surveillance, and personal transformation. Though his actions reflect a move toward autonomy, his fate remains constrained by the individuals and systems surrounding him.
